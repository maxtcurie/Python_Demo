	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {One modeling framework for integrated tasks (OMFIT) is a comprehensive integrated modeling framework which has been developed to enable physics codes to interact in complicated workflows, and support scientists at all stages of the modeling cycle. The OMFIT development follows a unique bottom-up approach, where the framework design and capabilities organically evolve to support progressive integration of the components that are required to accomplish physics goals of increasing complexity. OMFIT provides a workflow for easily generating full kinetic equilibrium reconstructions that are constrained by magnetic and motional Stark effect measurements, and kinetic profile information that includes fast-ion pressure modeled by a transport code. It was found that magnetic measurements can be used to quantify the amount of anomalous fast-ion diffusion that is present in DIII-D discharges, and provide an estimate that is consistent with what would be needed for transport simulations to match the measured neutron rates. OMFIT was used to streamline edge-stability analyses, and evaluate the effect of resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) on the pedestal stability, which have been found to be consistent with the experimental observations. The development of a five-dimensional numerical fluid model for estimating the effects of the interaction between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and microturbulence, and its systematic verification against analytic models was also supported by the framework. OMFIT was used for optimizing an innovative high-harmonic fast wave system proposed for DIII-D. For a parallel refractive index , the conditions for strong electron-Landau damping were found to be independent of launched and poloidal angle. OMFIT has been the platform of choice for developing a neural-network based approach to efficiently perform a non-linear multivariate regression of local transport fluxes as a function of local dimensionless parameters. Transport predictions for thousands of DIII-D discharges showed excellent agreement with the power balance calculations across the whole plasma radius and over a broad range of operating regimes. Concerning predictive transport simulations, the framework made possible the design and automation of a workflow that enables self-consistent predictions of kinetic profiles and the plasma equilibrium. It is found that the feedback between the transport fluxes and plasma equilibrium can significantly affect the kinetic profiles predictions. Such a rich set of results provide tangible evidence of how bottom-up approaches can potentially provide a fast track to integrated modeling solutions that are functional, cost-effective, and in sync with the research effort of the community.}

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Higher excitation states along the background field of plasma instabilities dominate over standard, ground-state eigenmodes once the gradient drive becomes sufficiently strong. At this point, mode parity can no longer be used as the sole identifier of microtearing activity. Not only ion- and electron-temperature-gradient-driven modes occur in higher states, but even trapped electron modes, where decorrelation mechanisms enable odd-parity mode structures without a vanishing bounce average. Nonlinearly, higher-order Hermite states imprint their structures on the turbulence. Even at considerably strong drive, however, quasilinear models can recover nonlinear fluxes, as long as all subdominantly unstable eigenmodes are included. Due to flux contributions from such modes, gradient scalings of fluxes can be stronger than linear expectations.}

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Measurements of local density and magnetic field fluctuations near the pedestal top, conditionally averaged over the edge localized mode (ELM) cycle, have been made in Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST). A Doppler backscattering (DBS) system installed at MAST was used to measure intermediate-k density fluctuations at the top of the pedestal. A novel diagnostic technique combining DBS with cross-polarization scattering (CP-DBS) enabled magnetic field fluctuations to also be locally measured at similar wave numbers. Polarization isolation and other effects for CP-DBS are discussed. Both measurements were used in a series of high-β –4.5) MAST plasmas with large type-I ELMs with an period where microtearing modes (MTMs) had been predicted to be unstable in similar conditions (Dickinson 2012 Phys. Rev. Lett. 108 135002). The measured density fluctuation level increased by a factor of about 4 between 2 and 4 ms after the ELM, which was correlated with the recovery of the density profile while the temperature pedestal height continued to increase slowly. Magnetic field fluctuations showed different temporal behaviors, slowly increasing throughout the ELM cycle as the local β increased. Linear GS2 calculations show both MTM and electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes unstable at similar wave numbers as the measurements (although with more overlap between ETG wave numbers and diagnostic spectral resolution) at the top of the pedestal, along with kinetic ballooning modes are unstable lower in the pedestal (at larger wavelengths). The inferred ratio of fluctuation levels from experiment was . The comparable ratios from GS2 were for the MTM and for the ETG. Both the experimental wave number range and the fluctuation ratio are more similar to the linear characteristics of the ETG than the MTM. These results imply that intermediate-k fluctuations due to the ETG play a role in inter-ELM pedestal evolution.}

Fusion 50 095010) for the calculation of neoclassical transport coefficients and flows. A key aspect of this work is the development of a fast numerical algorithm for treatment of the field particle operator. This Eulerian algorithm can accurately treat the disparate velocity scales that arise in the case of multi-species plasmas. Specifically, a Legendre series expansion in ξ (the cosine of the pitch angle) is combined with a novel Laguerre spectral method in energy to ameliorate the rapid numerical precision loss that occurs for traditional Laguerre spectral methods. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach to alternative spectral and finite-element schemes. The physical accuracy and limitations of more commonly used model collision operators, such as the Connor and Hirshman–Sigmar operators, are studied, and the effects on neoclassical impurity poloidal flows and neoclassical transport for experimental parameters are explored.}

	abstract = {Numerical studies of neoclassical transport, beginning with the fundamental drift-kinetic equation (DKE), have been extended to include the self-consistent coupling of electrons and multiple ion species. The code, NEO, provides a first-principles based calculation of the neoclassical transport coefficients directly from solution of the distribution function by solving a hierarchy of equations derived by expanding the DKE in powers of ρ*i, the ratio of the ion gyroradius to system size. This includes the calculation of the first-order electrostatic potential via the Poisson equation, although this potential has exactly no effect on the steady-state transport. Systematic calculations of the second-order particle and energy fluxes and first-order plasma flows and bootstrap current and comparisons with existing theories are given for multi-species plasmas. The ambipolar relation ∑azaΓa = 0, which can only be maintained with complete cross-species collisional coupling, is confirmed, and finite mass-ratio corrections due to the collisional coupling are identified. The effects of plasma shaping are also explored, including a discussion of how analytic formulae obtained for circular plasmas (i.e. Chang–Hinton) should be applied to shaped cases. Finite-orbit-width effects are studied via solution of the higher-order DKEs and the implications of non-local transport on the validity of the δf formulation are discussed.}

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {DIII-D physics research addresses critical challenges for the operation of ITER and the next generation of fusion energy devices. This is done through a focus on innovations to provide solutions for high performance long pulse operation, coupled with fundamental plasma physics understanding and model validation, to drive scenario development by integrating high performance core and boundary plasmas. Substantial increases in off-axis current drive efficiency from an innovative top launch system for EC power, and in pressure broadening for Alfven eigenmode control from a co-/counter-I p steerable off-axis neutral beam, all improve the prospects for optimization of future long pulse/steady state high performance tokamak operation. Fundamental studies into the modes that drive the evolution of the pedestal pressure profile and electron vs ion heat flux validate predictive models of pedestal recovery after ELMs. Understanding the physics mechanisms of ELM control and density pumpout by 3D magnetic perturbation fields leads to confident predictions for ITER and future devices. Validated modeling of high-Z shattered pellet injection for disruption mitigation, runaway electron dissipation, and techniques for disruption prediction and avoidance including machine learning, give confidence in handling disruptivity for future devices. For the non-nuclear phase of ITER, two actuators are identified to lower the L–H threshold power in hydrogen plasmas. With this physics understanding and suite of capabilities, a high poloidal beta optimized-core scenario with an internal transport barrier that projects nearly to Q = 10 in ITER at ∼8 MA was coupled to a detached divertor, and a near super H-mode optimized-pedestal scenario with co-I p beam injection was coupled to a radiative divertor. The hybrid core scenario was achieved directly, without the need for anomalous current diffusion, using off-axis current drive actuators. Also, a controller to assess proximity to stability limits and regulate β N in the ITER baseline scenario, based on plasma response to probing 3D fields, was demonstrated. Finally, innovative tokamak operation using a negative triangularity shape showed many attractive features for future pilot plant operation.}

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Fusion performance in tokamaks hinges critically on the efficacy of the edge transport barrier (ETB) in suppressing energy losses. The new concept of ‘fingerprints’ is introduced to identify the instabilities that cause transport losses in the ETBs of many of today’s experiments, from among widely posited candidates. Analysis of the gyrokinetic-Maxwell equations and gyrokinetic simulations of experiments reveals that each mode type produces characteristic ratios of transport in the various channels: density, heat, and impurities. This, together with experimental observations of transport in some channel or of the relative size of the driving sources of channels, can identify or determine the dominant modes causing energy transport. In multiple H-mode cases with edge-localized modes that are examined, these fingerprints indicate that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)-like modes are apparently not the dominant agent of energy transport; rather, this role is played by micro-tearing modes (MTMs) and electron temperature gradient (ETG) modes, and in addition, possibly by ion temperature gradient/trapped electron modes (ITG/TEM) on JET (Joint European Torus). MHD-like modes may dominate the electron particle losses. Fluctuation frequency can also be an important means of identification, and is often closely related to the transport fingerprint. The analytical arguments unify and explain previously disparate experimental observations on multiple devices, including DIII-D, JET, and ASDEX-U. Detailed simulations of two DIII-D ETBs also demonstrate and corroborate this.}

	abstract = {We report on a detailed study of magnetic fluctuations in the JET pedestal, employing basic theoretical considerations, gyrokinetic simulations, and experimental fluctuation data to establish the physical basis for their origin, role, and distinctive characteristics. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between gyrokinetic simulations of microtearing modes (MTMs) and two magnetic frequency bands with corresponding toroidal mode numbers n = 4 and 8. Such disparate fluctuation scales, with substantial gaps between toroidal mode numbers, are commonly observed in pedestal fluctuations. Here we provide a clear explanation, namely the alignment of the relevant rational surfaces (and not others) with the peak in the ω * profile, which is localized in the steep gradient region of the pedestal. We demonstrate that a global treatment is required to capture this effect. Nonlinear simulations suggest that the MTM fluctuations produce experimentally-relevant transport levels and saturate by relaxing the background electron temperature gradient, slightly downshifting the fluctuation frequencies from the linear predictions. Scans in collisionality are compared with a simple MTM dispersion relation. At the experimental points considered, MTM growth rates can either increase or decrease with collision frequency depending on the parameters thus defying any simple characterization of collisionality dependence.}

	abstract = {The gyrokinetic GENE code is used to study the inter-ELM H-mode pedestal profile evolution for an ASDEX Upgrade discharge. Density gradient driven trapped electron modes are the dominant pedestal instability during the early density-buildup phase. Nonlinear simulations produce particle transport levels consistent with experimental expectations. Later inter-ELM phases appear to be simultaneously constrained by electron temperature gradient (ETG) and kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) turbulence. The electron temperature gradient achieves a critical value early in the ELM cycle, concurrent with the appearance of both microtearing modes and ETG modes. Nonlinear ETG simulations demonstrate that the profiles lie at a nonlinear critical gradient. The nominal profiles are stable to KBM, but moderate increases in β are sufficient to surpass the KBM threshold. Certain aspects of the dynamics support the premise of KBM-constrained pedestal evolution; the density and temperature profiles separately undergo large changes, but in a manner that keeps the pressure profile constant and near the KBM limit.}

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {The H-mode pedestal height plays an important role in determining the global confinement of the tokamak plasma. In type I ELMy H-mode the ultimate limit for the pedestal pressure at constant width is set by the ideal MHD peeling-ballooning modes (PBMs) that are thought to be the trigger for the ELMs. However, the PBM criterion does not uniquely determine the pedestal. Increasing the width of the pedestal, the marginally peeling-ballooning stable pedestal height increases as well. The second criterion for the pedestal is set by the transport processes in the pedestal that limit the gradient between the ELMs. One candidate for driving this transport is the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) that is driven by the pressure gradient (Snyder et al 2009 Nucl. Fusion 49 085035). The KBM growth rate increases very rapidly after the critical pressure gradient is exceeded leading to very stiff profiles with the pressure gradient clamped near to the stability limit. In the local linear gyrokinetic analysis of experimental MAST and JET plasmas we have found that, like the ideal MHD ballooning modes, the KBMs can access locally so called second stability if the magnetic shear becomes low enough (Dickinson et al 2011 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 53 115010; Saarelma et al 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 123012). However, in the pedestal region the local assumption that the equilibrium can be considered radially constant for the investigated modes is no longer justified. In this paper we revisit the KBM analysis using a global code ORB5 to investigate whether second stability access exists for KBMs. We find that counter to the local analysis, the global KBM stability is not sensitive to the magnetic shear in the pedestal region. At sufficiently high β (but still below the ideal peeling-ballooning limit) the pedestal region becomes KBM unstable regardless of the amount of bootstrap current assumed in the equilibrium reconstruction. However, just as in local analysis, the mode is stabilised by reducing the pressure gradient. This suggests that KBMs can regulate the pedestal pressure gradient during the ELM cycle even when local analysis finds them stable due to high bootstrap current.}

	abstract = {JET has been unable to recover historical confinement levels when operating with an ITER-like wall (ILW) due largely to the inaccessibility of high pedestal temperatures. Finding a path to overcome this challenge is of utmost importance for both a prospective JET DT campaign and for future ITER operation. Gyrokinetic simulations (using the Gene code) quantitatively capture experimental transport levels for a representative experimental discharge and qualitatively recover the major experimental trends. Microtearing turbulence is a major transport mechanisms for the low-temperature pedestals characteristic of unseeded JET-ILW discharges. At higher temperatures and/or lower , we identify electrostatic ITG transport of a type that is strongly shear-suppressed on smaller machines. Consistent with observations, this transport mechanism is strongly reduced by the presence of a low-Z impurity (e.g. carbon or nitrogen at the level of ), recovering the accessibility of high pedestal temperatures. Notably, simulations based on dimensionless scans recover historical scaling behavior except in the unique JET-ILW parameter regime where ITG turbulence becomes important. Our simulations also elucidate the observed degradation of confinement caused by gas puffing, emphasizing the important role of the density pedestal structure. This study maps out important regions of parameter space, providing insights that may point to optimal physical regimes that can enable the recovery of high pedestal temperatures on JET.}

abstract = {The understanding and prediction of transport due to plasma microturbulence is a key open problem in modern plasma physics, and a grand challenge for fusion energy research. Ab initio simulations of such small-scale, low-frequency turbulence are to be based on the gyrokinetic equations, a set of nonlinear integro-differential equations in reduced (five-dimensional) phase space. In the present paper, the extension of the well-established and widely used gyrokinetic code GENE [F. Jenko, W. Dorland, M. Kotschenreuther, B.N. Rogers, Electron temperature gradient driven turbulence, Phys. Plasmas 7 (2000) 1904–1910] from a radially local to a radially global (nonlocal) version is described. The necessary modifications of both the basic equations and the employed numerical methods are detailed, including, e.g., the change from spectral methods to finite difference and interpolation techniques in the radial direction and the implementation of sources and sinks. In addition, code verification studies and benchmarks are presented.}

The focus is on assessing how close a reduced but significantly less computationally demanding model (TGLF) does in matching the more detailed model (CGYRO) in predicting scalings with driving gradient ("stiffness"). The impacts of other physics mechanisms such as flow shear, fast ions, and electromagnetic fluctuations on these predictions is also studied. Overall, while there are clear differences in the scaling, these do not appear to significantly impact the fidelity of the reduced model in prediction the experimental conditions studied relative to the more advanced model.},

We study ELMs triggered when the pedestal parameters are below the peeling-ballooning limit. These ELMs occur while the pedestal recovers after an ELM crash. We identify a mechanism by which a non-linear perturbation involving many active triads—a network of non-linear interactions – leads to the triggering of these ELMs. Each active triad leads to the non-linear transfer of energy between three waves, such that the network of non-linear interactions lead to a transfer of energy between many waves. The triggering of this non-linear perturbation systematically coincides with a pedestal perturbation induced by the neutral beam injection beams and localized near the magnetic surface of safety factor q = 5. Among the non-linear interactions detected during the ELM by a bi-coherence analysis, the most active triad involves a slow frequency that is qualitatively consistent with a geodesic acoustic mode located at the same location, i.e., near the q = 5 surface.}

The onset of radial magnetic fluctuations with frequencies above 200 kHz is found to correlate with the stagnation of the electron temperature pedestal gradient. During the presence of these magnetic fluctuations the gradients of the edge electron density and temperature are clamped and stable against the ELM onset. The detected magnetic fluctuation frequency is analysed for a variety of plasma discharges with different electron pressure pedestals. It is shown that the magnetic fluctuation frequency scales with the neoclassically estimated velocity at the plasma edge. This points to a location of the underlying instability in the gradient region. Furthermore, the magnetic signature of these fluctuations indicates a global mode structure with toroidal mode numbers of approximately 10. The fluctuations are also observed on the high field side with significant amplitude, indicating a mode structure that is symmetric on the low field side and high field side. The associated fluctuations in the current on the high field side might be attributed to either a strong peeling part or the presence of non-adiabatic electron response.}

The onset of the inter-ELM fluctuations is correlated with the evolution of the pedestal gradients. Three profile recovery phases are extracted, which are interlinked with the onsets of different kinds of pedestal fluctuations. Across machines it is found that the pedestal fluctuations can be assorted into at least three categories. These are determined by the fluctuation onset in the ELM cycle, observed frequency range and radial location in the pedestal. Further, the categories might be also related to different instabilities. Similar observations at various machines may point to a underlying generation mechanism that acts similarly for presently accessible pedestal parameter ranges.}

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {Washboard (WB) modes (Smeulders P et al 1999 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 41 1303) are a very common edge instability regularly observed in the H-mode regime in JET. They are detected as (normally several) bands of continuously fluctuating magnetic activity rotating in the direction of the electron diamagnetic drift with typical frequencies in the range of 10–90 kHz. The time evolution of the WB mode frequency is found to follow qualitatively the evolution of the electron temperature measured near the pedestal top, probably due to the strong diamagnetic drift associated with the large pedestal gradients. Evidence for their involvement in the pedestal and ELM dynamics will be presented. Increasing WB mode amplitude is correlated with an increase in the time between consecutive type-I ELMs. In situations in which a sudden increase (decrease) of WB mode activity is observed, the build-up of the pedestal temperature (and, linked to this, also of the pedestal pressure) of the electrons is seen to become slower (faster). This is a strong indication that the WB mode activity has a regulating effect on the pedestal and that it is responsible for an enhanced transport of energy across the separatrix. The occurrence of a class of type-I ELM precursor modes commonly observed in JET in discharges with low to moderate collisionality ( , roughly) (Perez C P et al EFDA-JET Preprint EFD-P(02)11) is found to be associated with a weakening of the WB modes. The underlying mechanism for this interaction has not been yet identified. In contrast to low triangularity discharges, WB activity is found to increase with gas puffing at high triangularity. This can provide an explanation for the regime recently identified on JET that has been called the mixed type-I/type-II ELM regime (Saibene G et al 2002 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 44 1769). A modified version of the peeling–ballooning cycle for type-I ELMs on JET that takes into account the WB mode phenomenon and is consistent with the experimental observations is proposed.
